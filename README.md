# Friend-Finder

### Created by Alexander Gonzalez

A compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from user surveys, then compare the answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. 

This app uses Express to handle routing and is deployed with Heroku so other users can fill out the survey.
